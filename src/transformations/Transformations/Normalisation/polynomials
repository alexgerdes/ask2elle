3*x + (2+foo y)*x + 6*y*(x^2) - (z^2)*2*3

make sum of left-products
remove -: Replace each - with a +, and introduce -1 ...

{3x, 2x, (foo y)x, 6yxx, -1zz2*3}

for each expression:
	multiply constants, and bring to front
	sort variable names

{3x, 2x, (foo y) x, 6xxy, -6zz}

group expression with equal sorted variable lists, adding constants

{5x, (foo y) x, 6xxy, -6zz}

sort expressions from left to right

Expr -> Maybe Expr
